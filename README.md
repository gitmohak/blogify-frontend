You can download and develop this awesome project yourself:
- Download all the source code files, provided on GitHub.

- You may view or modify the source code files using an Integrated Development Environment such as Microsoft VS Code.
- Install Node JS by downloading it from https://nodejs.org
- Open Terminal in the main folder of the source code files.
- Run the command, `npm install`, to install the Node Modules. These refer to the external packages used while making the Front-End of the project.
- Use `cd api` to navigate to the backend code.
- Run the command, `npm install`, to install the Node Modules. These refer to the external packages used while making the Back-End of the project.
- Run the command, `npm run dev`, to start the backend development server of the project.
- Use `cd..` to navigate to the frontend code.
- Run the command, `npm run start`, to see the live development preview of the project.
- For building, deploying, or hosting the Front-End of this website, you need to create the optimized build version as the development version is not optimal for handling actual web traffic. Run the command, `npm run build`. You may also have to serve the Back-End code provided in the  `api folder` in a Node JS server.<br><br>
